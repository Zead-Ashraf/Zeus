			<p>in this mode you can't do a lot, The page is working itself without any user-control as if you are watching a film, Things apper and dissapper automatically, and this was the main design</p>

			<h2>Interactive mode</h2>
			<p>In this mode you have to scroll down to make things work, And this design appers in my mind while I was working on Exhibition Mode, It is more user-control, And this is the sub-design</p>
